# Disclaimer
Most of the functionality of this program comes from [Devil4ngle's Idle_Slayer_Script](https://github.com/Devil4ngle/Idle_Slayer_Script). As I do not know how to code in AutoIt and have only just learned Python, I plan to translate most, if not all, features from [Devil4ngle's](https://github.com/Devil4ngle/Idle_Slayer_Script) program to mine. I also plan to add additional features that I wanted to implement in his program but was unable to do so since I did not learn AutoIt scripting.

# Instructions
1. Downalod any of the executables from the releases.
2. Set resoultion of game to: 1280x720.
3. Set game to Windowed
4. Make sure game is in focus.
5. Enable "Rounded Bulk Buy" & "Hide Locked Quest Rewards" in settings.
6. Disable "Confirm Dialogue" for portal in settings.
7. Do NOT! buy "Vertical Magnet" (Will be skipped by "Auto Buy Equipment & Upgrades" feature)
8. For minion collection to work correctly the "Leadership Master" Ascension upgrade is needed. (setting to disable minion collection WIP)
